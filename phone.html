        Do Smartphones have a place in the classroom?
        <br>
        <p>I think that phones do have a place in the classroom. They have a variety of uses that can enhance and support our learning that other devices like our laptops cannot. For example, our phones can take better quality photos than our laptops, while being a lot lighter and easier to carry. Taking photos can be useful, like if there was some information on the board or when taking a photography course and learning about different types of cameras with a phone being one of them. Another reason why students should be allowed phones is because the teachers use them. A teacher I had constantly used their phone for non school related things like texting her daughter in front of the class. If teachers are doing this then why can't students? Plus a teacher is not getting paid to text her daughter. </p>
